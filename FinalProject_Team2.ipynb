        "The Google Clab Notebook must be organized like a report where the code blocks are interspersed with text blocks. The text block that appears before the code block must cover the explanations of the approach. The text blocks that follow the output graphs and tables must contain inference, actionable insight, and recommendations. The code blocks themselves must be annotated with comments so they are readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook must contain the following sections:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Problem statement and justification for the proposed approach.\n",
        "* Data understanding (EDA) - a graphical and non-graphical representation of relationships between the response variable and predictor variables.\n",
        "* Data preparation.\n",
        "* Feature engineering - data pre-processing - missing values, outliers, etc.\n",
        "* Feature Selection - how were the features selected based on the data analysis?\n",
        "* Modeling - selection, comparison, tuning, and analysis - consider ensembles.\n",
        "* Evaluation - performance measures, results, and conclusions.\n",
        "* Discussion and conclusions - address the problem statement and recommendation."
